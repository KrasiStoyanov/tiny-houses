        <p class="body"> A residential structure under 46m2 is generally accepted to be a tiny home. Currently though, there is currently no set definition as to what constitutes as a tiny house. The                            movement associated with tiny houses is named "Tiny House Movement" and it is when people choose to downsize the space they live in. Among many reasons to join this movement,                        the most popular reasons include environmental concerns, financial concerns, and the desire for more time and freedom. </p>
              <p class="body"> The tiny house option can often be low-cost and is sometimes used to provide housing for the homeless; however, the long-term viability of tiny houses for the homeless is completely dependent on the structure and sustainability of the model.  
              <p class="body"> In the United States, the financial crisis of 2007â€“2008 fueled the growth of the small house movement.Smaller homes are less expensive than larger ones in terms of taxes and building, heating, maintenance, and repair costs. The lower cost of living may be advantageous to those 55 and older with little savings. In addition to costing less, small houses may encourage a less cluttered and simpler lifestyle and reduce ecological impacts for their residents. The typical size of a small home seldom exceeds 46 m2. The typical tiny house on wheels is usually less than 2.4m by 6.1m, with livable space totalling 11 m2 or less, for ease of towing and to exempt it from the need for a building permit.
              Small houses may emphasize design over size, utilize dual purpose features and multi-functional furniture, and incorporate technological advances of space saving equipment and appliances. Vertical space optimization is also a common feature of small houses and apartments. Housing the homeless is said to be a cost-saving for municipalities. Some of the benefits of access to housing include privacy, storage, safety, restoration of dignity and stability. </p>
