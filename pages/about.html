    <h3> Tiny Houses

    </h3>
        <p class="body"> A residential structure under 46m2 is generally accepted to be a tiny home. Currently though, there is currently no set definition as to what constitutes as a tiny house. The                        movement associated with tiny houses is named "Tiny House Movement" and it is when people choose to downsize the space they live in. Among many reasons to join this movement,                        the most popular reasons include environmental concerns, financial concerns, and the desire for more time and freedom. </p>
              <p class="body"> The tiny house option can often be low-cost and is sometimes used to provide housing for the homeless; however, the long-term viability of tiny houses for the homeless is completely dependent on the structure and sustainability of the model.
              <p class="body"> In the United States, the financial crisis of 2007–2008 fueled the growth of the small house movement.Smaller homes are less expensive than larger ones in terms of taxes and building, heating, maintenance, and repair costs. The lower cost of living may be advantageous to those 55 and older with little savings. In addition to costing less, small houses may encourage a less cluttered and simpler lifestyle and reduce ecological impacts for their residents. The typical size of a small home seldom exceeds 46 m2. The typical tiny house on wheels is usually less than 2.4m by 6.1m, with livable space totalling 11 m2 or less, for ease of towing and to exempt it from the need for a building permit.
              Small houses may emphasize design over size, utilize dual purpose features and multi-functional furniture, and incorporate technological advances of space saving equipment and appliances. Vertical space optimization is also a common feature of small houses and apartments. Housing the homeless is said to be a cost-saving for municipalities. Some of the benefits of access to housing include privacy, storage, safety, restoration of dignity and stability. </p>

        <h2>Who We Are </h2>
        <div><img src="../images/about/IMG_05212.png"><p>I have been fascinated about tiny houses since the first time I saw one. The concept of living in your own house with its unique look and cozy feeling is remarkable to me. Let alone the numerous benefits it offers to the environment, there's also the fact that waste reduction keeps on becoming more and more a part of the tiny house movement. One day, I myself want to buy tiny house that resembles a skyscraper, because it's appereance still gives you that feeling of living in a "normal" house but is actually a tiny one. I believe there should be more people living in tiny houses, since the houses people have been living in thus far are too usual, too ordinary. Granted, maybe tiny houses are not for everyone but how about we try something different, something more fun and better for our environment? At Teeny Tiny Houses, we can and will offer you the chance of customization to suit your needs and to turn your ideas of a tiny house's design into a new home, your home. </p> </div> 
        <div><img src="../images/about/krasi.jpeg"><p> I have always loved tiny houses because of how they resemble creativity in a unique way. That is what inspired me to create a company that offers unique tiny houses to those who would like to live in one,or those who own one and want another one and want to have a new experience with our unique products.</p> </div> 
        <div><img src="../images/about/aras.jpeg"><p>I've always had a an expencive taste but not enough money to support it. But the best thing about them is that since they are small they are cheap to build and maintain, because of that i can spend the money I saved to buy more expencive furniture, appliences and electronics. And because of that new passion for building tiny houses I decided to work here. - Aras - Senior engineer </p> </div> 
        <div><img src="../images/about/inka.jpeg"><p> I have always been interested in living as ecological as possible, and our tiny houses are a perfect solution. Living with low costs comes as a priority for the majority of people. I am constantly looking for new, more green solutions to use in our tiny houses, to not only create the perfect home for you, but also for your environment.</p> </div> 
        <div><img src="../images/about/rayn.jpeg"><p>Tiny houses are a compact and comfortable style of living that opens up your house to unconventional design opportunities.
