    <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <button class="accordion">What is a tiny house?</button>
          <div class="panel">
          Tiny houses are a freestanding and mobile home that is smaller than 50 meters square. Many tiny houses are build on flatbed trailers by their owners.
          </div>
      <button class="accordion">What are the benefits of a tiny house?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            The benefits of a tiny house are varied. You are more mobile with a tiny house, capable of moving it from one location to another. You also carry less stuff with you, as you don't have enough space to accumulate clutter.
          </div>
      <button class="accordion">Are tiny houses good for the environment?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            Yes! Tiny houses ar eknown for being environmentally conscious and using less resources than the average house. Due to their small size, they are much cheaper to heat. You can also opt to use recycled materials during the building process, or install solar panels.
          </div>
      <button class="accordion">How much does a tiny house cost to build?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            Tiny houses can cost anywhere between $10k to up to $50k for construction, depending on the materials used and the style of the house. Most professionally constructed tiny houses are between $30k and $50k. The cheapest owner-built homes can come under $10k.
          </div>
      <button class="accordion">Where can I put my tiny house?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            Most people park their tiny homes on their own property, or at a friend's or relative's property. Others use the mobility of their home to move from place to place. If the tiny house has RV or conventional plumbing, it is possible to park it in an RV trailer park.
            <br/> <br/> For the most part, tiny houses do not have zoning rules or ordinances put in place yet, leaving them in a legal gray area. There are, however, many communitities that have adapted to the popularity of tiny houses and allow you to permanently keep your home there.
            </div>
      <button class="accordion">Are tiny houses legal? Do they have special regulations?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            While some communities have building restrictions on alternative housing, others do not. As most tiny houses are built on trailers they fall under 'travel trailer' categories and building codes do not apply. If you are building your tiny home on a foundation, then you must still follow building codes for your area.
